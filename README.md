# ffi

## Overview
`ffi` is a project aimed at simplifying the use of Foreign Function Interface (FFI) in Rust for interacting with other languages like C. It contains bindings that allow Rust code to call C functions and vice versa.

## Features
- Rust and C integration using FFI.
- Provides low-level bindings for cross-language functionality.
- Built with `Cargo` for easy dependency management.

## Installation
To include this in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ffi = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
```rust
extern crate ffi;

fn main() {
    // Example of using a function from the FFI
    ffi::example_function();
}
```
